# Happy Day

Happy Day is the result of a project at Esslingen University of Applied Science.
Our goal of the project was to learn how CNNs work and how to integrate them into an application. 
Our vision of an application was to detect a users emotion by capturing a portrait of the user and send this very portrait to our server, where we are evaluating the images about their inhabitited emotions. 

Happy Day consists of three repositories:

- [**happy-day-app**](/getting_started/app): Android app source code
- [**happy-day-service**](/getting_started/service): Flask webservice and CNN training cli
- [**happy-day-live**](/getting_started/live): Sources for live evaluation with your webcam, to show transitions between emotions
